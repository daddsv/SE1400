        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p> My competitors would be other people around my age as, although this isn't technically an resume, this serves around the same purpose. I am trying to show others how my collection of skills may be better than others. Many other people have a lot of engineering things on their website, and even though I don't have engineering experience, I have alot of math and a good amount of coding experience.</p>
